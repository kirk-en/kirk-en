## Hi there 👋 I'm Kirk

- 🔭 I'm building [glyphart](https://glyphart.io), a community connecting art collectors with artists for studio visits and direct purchases.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Shopify's GraphQL Admin API, Docker, web crawling with Node (Puppeteer, Cheerio), and algorithmic video editing.
- 🧠 Endlessly curious about languages, entrepreneurship, coding, APIs, and computer science.
- 🎨 Former startup content maven – can Photoshop app assets without needing to bother the design team and update the office dog sizzle reel for this year's offsite.
